## About

Vault is a password-storage utility. It stores passwords using the AES encryption protocol, which can later be decrypted and read by the vault owner.

## WARNING

I'm in no way an expert in shell scripting or cryptography. However, I'll try to update this script regularly and make it more robust and safe. 
I hope this script will eventually be analysed by security experts so that it can be used with more confidence.

## Instalation

Run this command: 

```
git clone https://github.com/lhugens/vault && cd vault && make install && cd -
